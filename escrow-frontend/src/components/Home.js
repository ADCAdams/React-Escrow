            A smart contract is a computer protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract. 
            Smart contracts allow the performance of credible transactions without third parties.

                <br/>
            <span>
                These smart contracts behave similarly, they can't be changed once created! Once they are validated by both users they will release the fund to the seller!
